KING Adinkra, an Ivorian King is the originator of Adinkra as it is believed that the king
 wore exceptional attire with well patterned symbolic ‘symbols’ which denotes special
 meanings. King Adinkra dies by the ‘sword’ of the Ashanti King, Nana Osei Bonsu in 1818
 for insulting him.
 
The death of King Adinkra passes on a new cultural practice in the
Ashanti Kingdom; the patterns on King Adinkra’s cloth becomes the inheritance to the
Ashantis which would be passed on from generation to generation. 

Local folks of Adinkra village say, ‘The first men created the symbols to make the cloth 
and that the traditional symbols were (66) but as time went by, new symbols were introduced, 
hence some symbols could have more than one symbols but same meanings, as seen in Plate 1.0. 

And these symbols could have historic meanings, proverbial, parables, aphorisms which I believe, 
forms the norms and values of people in the community and echoes their meanings when printed 
or affixed onto surfaces.
